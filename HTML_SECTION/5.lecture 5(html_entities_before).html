                    Out of the mouth of a fictional character to our ears comes the
                    secret of success. Whether the writers knew it or unwittingly
                    stumbled on it, what they wrote was the absolute truth. The ONE
                    Thing is the best approach to getting what you want.
                    I didn’t really get this until much later. I’d experienced
                    success in the past, but it wasn’t until I hit a wall that I began to
                    connect my results with my approach. In less than a decade we’d
                    built a successful company with national and international
                    ambitions, but all of a sudden things weren’t working out. For all
                    the dedication and hard work, my life was in turmoil and it felt as
                    if everything was crumbling&nbsp;around me.
